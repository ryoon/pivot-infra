This file contains a description of all optional (but useful) steps to do AFTER a Pivot (official, public) Release.

Use it only as a sample.

Note that all scripts are UNIX shell scripts, so you need a compatible environment, with installed even:
- Apache Subversion client
- Java JDK installed and other jar libraries dependencies, as required by Pivot
- Apache Ant, as required by Pivot
- Apache Maven (optional)
- Apache RAT, from Apache, currently from here: http://incubator.apache.org/rat/
  or use the jar under infra/lib (only for convenience put here)

Memory and disk space required:
- 512 MB of RAM to do the build
- 1 GB of free disk space for downloaded files and temp and build artifacts


Required steps:

1 - Mandatory: Publish Binary and Source artifacts in Apache Release repository (svn), here:

https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pivot

and even release-notes html file (get some parts of it from JIRA Release Notes).
Then mark that release as Released in JIRA.


2 - Not mandatory, but important: Publish Pivot jars in Central Maven Repository:
Log in into Central Maven Repository Manager at: https://repository.apache.org/
Select Repositories, then Releases (IMPORTANT), and in the related lower half of the page do the following steps
for any pivot-<release>-bundle*.zip generated (unzip any in a dedicated subfolder, 
starting from the root one, without jars inside):
- select Artifact Upload
- Gav Definition, choose From POM, and select the pom.xml file in the subproject folder
- Select Artifact(s) to Upload, and choose the jar and Add Artifact 
  (then the same for related -javadoc and -sources jars if present), and Upload Artifact(s)

Verify uploads, doing a Search and ensure that all are in the right place and with the right classifier.
Another check could be done by manually browsing to this folder:
http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/pivot/
or even on https if needed.


3 - Not mandatory, but important: Publish related JavaDoc and updated Demos/Tutorials in Web Site,
and then maybe cleanup old JavaDoc files. Remember to test Demos/Tutorials.
If possible, keep existing binary artifacts for older versions.


4 - Optional: Update dependencies in experimental projects under /skunk , like:
- pivot-archetype-quickstart, update dependencies in src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml


5 - OBSOLETE: Optional: Update dependencies in related projects under Apache-Extras:
for a list of all pivot-related projects there, use:
http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/hosting/search?q=pivot&btn=Search+projects

The operations to do are (most of times) these:
update dependencies, rebuild all, tag sources, 
then publish updated jars for the project and make them features so it's easy to see/download

These are main subprojects to update:
- pivot-jfree,
  important because it's a common requirement for doing charts with Pivot
- pivot-common, 
  important because it share Pivot jars and other common things to many other pivot-related projects here,
  and it contains even other common subprojects and dependencies that could be useful to others here,
  and even the pivot-maven-archetype jar to download it from here just for convenience
- pivot-contrib,
  with some user-contributed projects ... so this usually if updated by our users
- pivot-demos,
  with inside an exploded pivot-demos-jfree,
  the wiki page Pivot_JFree_Demos to test "live" from here Pivot-JFree Demos (Applet),
  the pivot-demos-jfree.war to download it from here just for convenience
- pivot-extras,
  with some extra inside
- pivot-multilang,
  with some common and specific subprojects for Scala and Groovy (and maybe for others JVM languages) projects,
  normal and even maven projects (and maybe Gradle and Sbt projects)
- pivot-stuff,
  note that this contains many subprojects inside, like:
  apache-pivot-grails plugin, pivot-java-test-maven, 
  pivot-stuff-extensions, 
  pivot-stuff-media, pivot-stuff-validation, 
  pivot-stuff-web, 
  scala-use-pivot2, 
  and others ...
- etc ...


6 - Optional: Update Demos in other sites (usually not handled by us, but by some our users):
